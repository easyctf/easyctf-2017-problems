Write a program that takes an integer `n` as input.

Output the numbers 1 through `n`, in increasing order, one per line. 

However, replace any line that is a multiple of 3 with `Fizz` and any that are a multiple of 5 with `Buzz`. Any line that is a multiple of 3 and 5 should be written as `FizzBuzz`.

The input will be the number of lines to write, n, followed by a linebreak.

Sample input:

```
17
```

Sample output:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
```
